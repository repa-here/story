Long before Azara was shaped, before races walked beneath ordered skies, the galaxy was torn by war.

The Titans clashed with the Old Gods, beings empowered by the Void itself. The conflict was swift, ruthless, and without mercy. It was a war that could not truly be won, for the death of an Old God would unravel reality and bring destruction beyond repair.

Knowing this, the Titans chose imprisonment.

With divine force, they bound the Old Gods and cast them into isolated planets and forgotten moons. Chains forged from celestial metal were wrapped around their forms. These chains were blessed by the Sun itself, their sacred power draining corruption, weakening evil, and slowly stripping the Old Gods of their strength.

Balance was restored, but fear remained.

For the Titans knew there was another.

The strongest among the Old Gods.
The first master of darkness.
The creator of the Void Lords themselves.

His name was Valthorak.

From his earliest existence, Valthorak studied forbidden magic. He bent shadow into form, conjured demons, and tore creatures from the Legion into reality. His power was vast, cruel, and growing. Even the Titans feared what he might become.

Then one day, Valthorak vanished.

He became a wandering shadow, unseen and unchallenged. He traveled from planet to planet, gathering relics, corpses, arcane remnants, and forgotten knowledge. Every world he touched was left hollow.

Until he reached Eldora.

Once, Eldora had been beautiful. Now it was nothing but ash and silence, its skies choked and its surface dead. Yet in the center of that ruined world, something remained.

A flower.

It glowed with a deep purple light, untouched by fire, time, or decay. The ground around it was lifeless, but the flower stood perfect and unbroken. When touched, it poisoned slowly, draining magic from the body like blood from a wound.

Valthorak knew at once he had found perfection.

He remained on Eldora for years. He gathered countless flowers, harvesting them carefully, studying their nature. Through experimentation, he learned the truth of their power. The flower drained everything it touched. Magic, life force, enchantments, even the strength bound within weapons and grimoires. Nothing resisted it.

He named the flower Nyx.

Through alchemy and endless labor, Valthorak refined their essence. He condensed their power into a single substance, thick with Void energy. To contain it, he forged a vessel from the hardest steel taken from the Hell Lands, metal tempered in suffering and fire.

The relic was shaped into a rhombus, divided into four fragments, each able to channel the essence independently. When the fragments were bound together, the artifact pulsed like a living heart.

He named the relic Nyxara.

Yet it was incomplete.

Nyxara could drain magic, but it lacked the force needed to drown worlds in chaos. For that, it required something greater.

A god.

Valthorak searched for a worthy source and found it on the planet Devir. There, upon a massive pillar, was sealed the God of Curses, bound and forgotten. The Old God saw Valthorak and believed salvation had come.

He was wrong.

Valthorak felt no mercy. Only hunger.

He pressed Nyxara against the god’s chest. The relic awakened instantly. Light flared purple and black as Nyxara began to drain him. Magic, essence, divinity, and life were torn away and drawn into the gem.

The screams echoed, but no one heard them. Devir was isolated, forgotten, and silent.

When it was over, the god was nothing more than dust.

Nyxara burned brighter than ever.

Thus, the relic was complete.

A vessel forged from the Void.
A bloom turned into damnation.
A gem that devoured magic and life itself.

And far away, unseen by the Titans, Nyxara waited to be unleashed upon creation.
