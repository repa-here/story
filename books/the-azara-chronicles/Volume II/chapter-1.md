This was the planet Azara—a world where peace was law rather than hope. Spanning three vast continents, Azara thrived in harmony, rich with untamed wilderness, breathtaking creatures, and mythical foliage found nowhere else. Kingdoms rose beside ancient forests, and for generations its people believed their world had reached a perfect, unbreakable balance.

Life followed an unchanging rhythm. Empires grew slowly, nature flourished freely, and the idea of true catastrophe was little more than a myth whispered in old stories.

That illusion shattered with the beginning of what would later be called the First Paradox.

Deep beneath the mountains of Stonehelm, a young dwarf labored in the mines as countless others had before him. His pick struck stone again and again—until it hit something wrong. The sound was sharper, hollow, unlike any mineral known to dwarven kind. Buried far below the earth lay a small fragment: a broken shard of some ancient artifact.

It was beautiful in a disturbing way, smooth and shining, yet it radiated something unnatural. When the dwarf lifted it, strength drained from his body, as though the shard itself fed on his life. Such a small thing should not have held such power.

News of the discovery spread rapidly across Azara. Human scholars examined it with careful reverence. Wood Elves tested it through alchemy and magic. Others searched their histories for answers long forgotten. Years passed as the races of Azara worked together, united by curiosity and unease.

Eventually, one truth could no longer be denied.

The fragment did not belong to their world.

Soon after this realization, Azara itself began to react. Storms formed without warning, black clouds swallowing clear skies. The ground trembled—first like distant thunder, then with violent force that shook cities and split stone. Mountains groaned. Seas churned.

Then it happened.

A God descended upon Azara.

His arrival sent a shockwave across all three continents. Forests bent, oceans raged, and the sky itself seemed to scream. The world recoiled as though it recognized something that should never have touched its soil.

In that moment, the people of Azara understood.

Something far worse than disaster had arrived.

From the God’s shadow—long, writhing, alive—a demon emerged. Its form defied nature, its presence suffocating. It did not shout or threaten. It had no need to.

It spoke only once.

“Learn more about this gross world.”

With a bow, the demon unfurled wings of hellfire and vanished into the skies.

Months passed.

Life slowly resumed its rhythm, but fear lingered like a wound that refused to heal. Then the rumors began. Travelers spoke of a dark shape gliding above the clouds. Some swore they had seen wings burning against the sky.

At first, the stories were dismissed as fear-born fantasies. Then messengers arrived. Livestock was found scorched. Watchtowers stood abandoned. Entire patrols vanished without a trace. Survivors spoke of a demon testing their strength—one no blade could wound.

Scholars grew silent. Generals sharpened their plans.

For the first time, the rulers of Azara accepted the truth: this God had not come from the heavens.

He had risen from hell.

When the demon returned, it brought proof of its judgment. Before its lord, it cast the severed head of a Wood Elf onto the ground.

“Ul’Thar Na Vorn. Zhar’Krax Nih Vern.”

Though the language was ancient and unknown, the meaning was clear.

They are weak. Their lives mean nothing.

The God smiled—a slow, predatory expression—and spoke only three words.

“Let’s bring the army.”

Raising his hands to the sky, he began to chant. The magic that answered him was forbidden—ancient beyond comprehension, dangerous beyond control. The clouds darkened, turning the color of deep wine, growing heavier with every word.

Then a blinding beam tore through the heavens.

From it descended two more demons, each different, each carrying power that twisted the air around them. When they touched the ground, rain began to fall.

Blood-red rain.

The scent of death filled the air.

Across Azara, humans prayed in silence. Fear gripped them, but it did not break them. If death was coming, they would face it standing. Dwarfs returned to their forges, crafting axes and hammers stronger than ever before. War was inevitable.

Among the Wood Elves, one elder—who had seen the demons with his own eyes—raced through his library. In a forgotten tome, buried beneath dust and legend, he found images that made his blood run cold.

Demons standing before great gates.

“Do these demons represent the gates of hell?” he whispered.

Far beneath the mountains of Stonehelm, the dwarves already knew the answer.

The monsters were coming.

And they were coming for the shard.
