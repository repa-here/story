This is our planet, Azara, a place where everyone lived together and peace was the rule. Spreading across three continents, Azara was rich in its own nature. It was a home to beautiful animals and mythical foliage.

For generations, life on Azara followed an unchanging rhythm. Kingdoms grew, forests flourished, and its people believed their age of peace would last forever.

Everything changed when the First Paradox began.

One day, while a young dwarf was mining deep within the mines of Stonehelm, his pick struck something unlike any stone before it. Buried far beneath the earth lay a small fragment, a broken shard from some type of artifact. It was small and shiny, yet something about it was odd.

The fragment held power. Holding it drained his stamina, almost like magic itself was being pulled away. Such a small shard, yet so powerful.

Word of the discovery spread quickly. Human scholars studied it, Wood Elves experimented with alchemy, and others sought answers through their own knowledge. Years passed as the peoples of Azara worked together to uncover the truth.

In time, one fact became undeniable.
This fragment was not from their own planet.

Not long after this realization, the world itself began to change. Storms appeared without warning, dark clouds gathering across the skies of Azara. The ground trembled, slowly at first, like distant earthquakes, growing stronger with each passing day.

Then it happened.

A God itself appeared upon the planet of Azara. His arrival unleashed a massive shockwave that rippled across all three continents, shaking cities, forests, and mountains alike. Seas raged, the sky screamed, and the earth itself seemed to recoil in fear.

At that moment, the people of Azara knew.

Something was coming.
