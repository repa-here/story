Once the words were spoken, God lifted his head toward the sky. With his hands raised above him, he began chanting some sort of magic, a power that was not normal.

Forbidden. Ancient. Dangerous.

Slowly, clouds filled the sky, but their color was unusual. They were dark red, the color of wine. With every word he chanted, the red grew deeper.

Then everyone saw a bright beam strike the sky, cutting through the clouds like butter.

Two more demons emerged from it, each different, each holding its own power.

When they touched the ground, rain began to fall. Rain of blood. The air filled with the smell of death and hatred.

Many humans prayed in silence. They feared what was coming, but fear did not break them. If death was coming upon Azara, they would meet it standing.

Dwarfs began forging new axes and hammers, reinforcing them with more iron. They were ready for war.

But one old man among the Wood Elves, who had seen them from up close, rushed to his library. He had read about something like this before, an old, forgotten legend.

Opening a dusty book, he found illustrations of something that made him ask the question:

“Do these demons represent the gates of hell?”

Meanwhile, the people of Stonehelm knew.

These monsters were coming.
They were coming for the shard.
